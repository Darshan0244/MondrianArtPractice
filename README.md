# MondrianArtPractice
Mondrian art with CSS uses **Flexbox** and **Grid** to create layouts with colorful blocks. Flexbox helps align boxes in rows or columns, while Grid arranges them in a two-dimensional layout. You control the size and position of boxes to mimic Mondrianâ€™s abstract style, making this a fun way to practice CSS layout skills.
